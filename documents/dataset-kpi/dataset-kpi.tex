\section{Project Summary}
In this project, we aim to analyze geographical crime information in Tallahasse, FL, collected from Tallahassee Police Statistics. In particular, we conduct traditional data analysis to identify crime patterns and trends, and use \verb|pix2pix| to create a heatmap of crime in Tallahassee. We also aim to create a web application to visualize the data and provide insights to the public.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze crime data to identify patterns and trends
    \item Create a heatmap of crime in Tallahassee using \verb|pix2pix|
    \item Develop a web application to visualize the data
\end{itemize}
